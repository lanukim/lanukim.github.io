## About

I am an assistant professor at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). After finishing my sociology PhD at the University of Washington, I was a postdoctoral fellow and data science scholar at Sanford University. My research broadly contributes to the theoretical understanding of academic knowledge creation by mainly examining the impact of academic search engines, gender inequality in higher education, and the social structure of knowledge construction. To investigate, I utilize new big data sources, innovative analytical strategies, natural language processing, and advanced statistical methods and work with interdisciplinary research teams. I am always open to new collaboration opportunities. Please contact me via email if you are interested.

## Projects and Publications/Working Papers

### Echo chambers in science?

While pursuing my Ph.D., I examined how technology has shaped our work practices among academics by focusing on the ways in which scientists engage with prior scientific literature. My dissertation idea was developed into an NSF-funded project, “Echo Chambers in Science” ([Link](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1735194&HistoricalAwards=false)). This project, which grew out of conversations I initiated with my advisor, investigated how the development of integrated academic search engines like Google Scholar may have transformed the citation behavior of researchers across multiple scientific fields.

### Gender inequality in academia

As a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford, I have been involved in projects that study the role of gender in the process of knowledge creation. I began a project to investigate whether gendered research interests contribute to women’s underrepresentation in the professoriate. Through analyzing nearly 1 million PhDs who received a degree in U.S. institutions, this research has employed natural language processing techniques and advanced statistical methods to locate potential systematic bias toward particular research ideas. I have found that scientific knowledge associated with women (e.g., schooling or infants) is devalued in academia.

### Social and conceptual networks in academia

I have been examining the structure of the formation of collaboration networks among faculty by combining several types of data sets, including grants, publications, and dissertation committees. In this project, I ask how faculty develops different types of collaborations and how to find who to connect.

## Agenda on Teaching and Research
As a sociology Ph.D. participating in multiple projects rooted in big data and computational methods, I present three elements of my agenda that I bring to my teaching and research.  

1. I believe the future of scholarship lies in interdisciplinary research. From my academic experience, I recognize that advances in data science have the potential to unlock enormous opportunities that will require both excellent data management/analysis expertise and the ability to ask key research questions. Thus, one primary motivation for my work lies in fully exploring these research opportunities.

2. I have found a unique role for sociology in data science research pursued by such interdisciplinary teams. Sociology offers abundant theoretical scaffolding, which helps explain underlying organizational processes found in big data. My research and mentorship provide an insightful perspective that can guide big data research to have both theoretical and substantive meanings in society, which strengthens my niche in interdisciplinary research.  

3. I am committed to encouraging gender and racial/ethnic minority scholars to utilize data science. While computational methods are shaping many new research directions in the social sciences, ingrained cultural beliefs concerning gender have frequently and consistently discouraged women from pursuing math-based career trajectories.
