## About

I am an associate professor in the school of Digital humanities and computational social sciences ([Link](https://hss.kaist.ac.kr/boards/view/fulltime_professor_en/89)) and a joint professor in the school of computing ([Link](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/people/view?idx=620&kind=faculty&menu=171)) and the graduate school of data science, Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST). After finishing my sociology PhD at the University of Washington, I was a postdoctoral fellow and data science scholar at Stanford University. My research broadly contributes to the theoretical understanding of academic knowledge creation by mainly examining the impact of academic search engines, gender inequality in higher education, and the social structure of knowledge construction. To investigate, I utilize new big data sources, innovative analytical strategies, natural language processing, and advanced statistical methods and work with interdisciplinary research teams. I am always open to new collaboration opportunities. Please contact me via email if you are interested.

If you’re interested in projects that are under review or have drafts ready, I’d be happy to share — just send me an email.

## Projects and Publications/Working Papers

### Technology and society

From my PhD journey at the University of Washington to my time at KAIST, I’ve felt a strong societal need to study rapidly evolving technologies and their social impacts. Researching constantly developing technology is challenging — like aiming at a moving target — but I believe it’s one of the most essential tasks for contemporary sociologists. Using computational methods, ethnography, interviews, and surveys, I explore technological change and its implications for social inequality.

### Knowledge structure with a global perspective

Where I stand shapes my perspective and research interests, and this stream of research reflects my standpoint as a researcher located in a non-western higher eudcation system. I draw implications of this global structure in our scientific knowledge-making process with a critical perspective backed by data-driven analyses.

### Gender in academia and professional jobs

As a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford, I have been involved in projects that study the role of gender in the process of knowledge creation. I began a project to investigate whether gendered research interests contribute to women’s underrepresentation in the professoriate. I extend these interests by examining both gender differences in research topical interests and the gender pay gap across various national contexts.

[Link](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0262027)

### Gender in LLM

As more students become interested in exploring potential amplified gender inequalities in large language models (LLMs), I have started a few projects that study or utilize LLMs to examine existing inequalities in our society. Here are projects currently in development.

Wenchao Dong, **Lanu Kim**, Mia Cha. "Algorithmic Implications of Gender Wage Gap and Stereotypes in the Tech Sector." [under review]

### Social and conceptual networks in academia

I study how scientific knowledge evolves by extracting concepts from text and collaboration networks using natural language processing and social network analysis. This set of articles reflects that research focus.

**Lanu Kim**, Vivek Kulkarni, Daniel McFarland. "Modeling Tie Dynamics in Ideational Spaces of Scientific Fields - A Network Theoretic Approach." [draft ready]

### Data science for law and crime 

We all talk about AI judges and lawyers, but have we seen a reliable model? Legal text data is highly unstructured, and everyday legal practice doesn’t always fit mathematical models. I study law and crime, exploring how data science can be applied in this field and examining what AI can — and cannot — do.

### Echo chambers in science?

While pursuing my Ph.D., I examined how technology has shaped our work practices among academics by focusing on the ways in which scientists engage with prior scientific literature. My dissertation idea was developed into an NSF-funded project, “Echo Chambers in Science” ([Link](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1735194&HistoricalAwards=false)). This project, which grew out of conversations I initiated with my advisor, investigated how the development of integrated academic search engines like Google Scholar may have transformed the citation behavior of researchers across multiple scientific fields.

## Agenda on Teaching and Research
As a sociology Ph.D. participating in multiple projects rooted in big data and computational methods, I present three elements of my agenda that I bring to my teaching and research.  

1. I believe the future of scholarship lies in interdisciplinary research. From my academic experience, I recognize that advances in data science have the potential to unlock enormous opportunities that will require both excellent data management/analysis expertise and the ability to ask key research questions. Thus, one primary motivation for my work lies in fully exploring these research opportunities.

2. I have found a unique role for sociology in data science research pursued by such interdisciplinary teams. Sociology offers abundant theoretical scaffolding, which helps explain underlying organizational processes found in big data. My research and mentorship provide an insightful perspective that can guide big data research to have both theoretical and substantive meanings in society, which strengthens my niche in interdisciplinary research.  

3. I am committed to encouraging gender and racial/ethnic minority scholars to utilize data science. While computational methods are shaping many new research directions in the social sciences, ingrained cultural beliefs concerning gender have frequently and consistently discouraged women from pursuing math-based career trajectories.
